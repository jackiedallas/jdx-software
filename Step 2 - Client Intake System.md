# Step 2 - Client Intake System

The goal is to qualify, organize, and onboard clients with **clarity and consistency**. This system should work while you're at work, in class, or with your kids.

## ðŸ”¹ 1. Build a Smart Intake Form

Use **Tally**, **Typeform**, or **Google Forms** to collect key info upfront.

### Recommended Questions

1. **Name**
2. **Email**
3. **Phone Number**
4. **Business Name**
5. **What does your business do?**
6. **Do you already have a domain?**
7. **Do you already have branding?** (Logo, colors, font)
8. **What pages do you need?** (Check options: Home, About, Services, Blog, Contact, etc.)
9. **Do you have your website content ready?** (Text, photos, etc.)
10. **Any websites you like or want to use as inspiration?**
11. **Do you need a blog or CMS?**
12. **Any features or integrations you want?** (e.g. form, calendar, newsletter)
13. **Estimated budget?**
14. **Ideal launch timeline?**
15. **Anything else you'd like to share?**

## ðŸ”¹ 2. Set Up a Lead Tracker

Use **Notion**, **Airtable**, or **Google Sheets** to manage all incoming leads.

### Suggested Columns

- Client Name
- Contact Info
- Tier (LaunchPad / Growth Site)
- Project Stage (Lead / In Progress / Delivered / On Hold)
- Estimated Value
- Intake Form Submitted? (Yes/No)
- Deposit Paid?
- Notes / Last Contact

> âœ… Pro Tip: Connect this to your form via Zapier for auto population

---

## ðŸ”¹ 3. Automate Initial Client Response

Send a prewritten response when a form is submitted.

### Example Template

> Subject: Thanks for Reaching Out to JDX Software ðŸš€  
>
> Hi [Client Name],  
> 
> Thanks for filling out our project intake form! Weâ€™re reviewing your info and will follow up within 1â€“2 business days.  
>
> If weâ€™re a good fit, weâ€™ll send over a proposal and timeline based on your goals.  
>
> In the meantime, feel free to reply with any additional info.  
>
> Talk soon,  
> Jackie  
> *Founder, JDX Software*

> âœ… Bonus: Hook this into a Zap that drops their info into your tracker + emails them this response

## ðŸ”¹ 4. Optional: Pre-Discovery Intake Call

Only if neededâ€”donâ€™t default to meetings. But if budget is right and project seems unclear:

**15â€“20 min video call to:**

- Clarify their goals
- Set expectations
- Confirm fit (budget, scope, timeline)

Keep it lean. If theyâ€™re not a fit, refer them out or recommend the LaunchPad tier.

## âœ… Output of Step 2

- A clear, professional client intake form
- A CRM-style lead tracker
- A fast-response email template
- A light discovery process when needed
