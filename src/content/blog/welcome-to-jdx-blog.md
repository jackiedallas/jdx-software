**Pulse** is the official blog of JDX Software. It’s where we share the heartbeat of our ideas—how they evolve, how we build them, and how they help developers and creators solve real problems.
I'm Jackie Ray Johnson-Dallas, founder of JDX Software. I’m building products like [Manualize](https://manualize.app) to reduce friction in technical work—starting with better documentation. This blog is where I think out loud along the way.

## Why This Blog Exists

We’ve shipped enough to know that software alone isn’t the problem—unclear processes, bad documentation, and communication breakdowns are.

Pulse exists to share how we’re solving that. Not with hype. Not with fluff. Just tools that respect your time and work.

## What’s Next?

We’ve got a lot lined up:

* Why I’m not selling Manualize as “AI-powered”
* How we’re turning command-line history into documentation
* A new way to get your infrastructure processes documented without lifting a finger

If you're interested in better tooling, less fluff, and building in the open—you're in the right place.

*This post marks the beginning of Pulse. Thanks for being here as we build what’s next.*
